		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so
			worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check
			the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist
			slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).
		</p>
		<p>
			Risotto ranks right up there as one of the greatest dishes you can make
			with rice. Originating in Italy, risotto is a recipe made by simmering a
			starchy variety of rice in broth, with flavor-boosting ingredients added
			like onions, garlic, vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese. This
			5-star recipe for mushroom risotto has thousands of ratings and reviews.

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Hot broth</h3>
				<p>
					Keep the broth hot the whole way through. Measure out a little more
					into the broth pot than the recipe says to make up for evaporation as
					it sits.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Toast and rice</h3>
				<p>
					An essential step to making risotto is to toast the grains in hot oil
					until they start to turn translucent around the edges. This could take
					a couple of minutes. Stir continuously during this process.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Stir</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, you stir risotto as it simmers. That's what helps release the
					starch from the grains of rice to make that creamy texture you want.
					Do you have to stir constantly? No. Stir after each half cup of broth
					you add to make sure the broth is distributed evenly, then stir again
					every 30 seconds or so until almost all the broth is absorbed. Add
					another half cup of broth and repeat. Listen to music. Sip some wine.
					Good risotto is worth the time it takes.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Temperature</h3>
				<p>Keep the broth hot and the risotto at a low simmer throughout.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Texture</h3>
				<p>
					Risotto is done when the rice is al dente: firm but not crunchy when
					you bite into it. It should not be as dry as steamed rice, but should
					have enough liquid to make it loose. Add just a touch more broth if
					needed before stirring in the butter and Parmesan cheese.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Serve immediately</h3>
				<p>
					Risotto waits for no one. It will continue to cook as it sits even
					when it's off the heat, so be prepared to dish it up right away.
