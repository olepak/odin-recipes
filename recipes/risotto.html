		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so
			worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check
			the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist
			slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).
